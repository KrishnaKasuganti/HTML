            <p id="Dtext">Hyderabad is the capital of the Indian state of Telangana. 
            It is a historic city noted for its many monuments, temples, mosques 
            and bazaars. A multitude of influences has shaped the character of 
            the city in the last 400 years. The city of Hyderabad was founded 
            by the Qutb Shahi sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 CE. It was 
            built around the Charminar, which formed the centerpiece of the city. 
            Hyderabad became an important trading centre for diamonds and pearls, 
            and a centre for culture. After a brief period of Mughal rule, the 
            first Nizam of Hyderabad conquered the city in 1724. The Nizams later 
            signed a subsidiary alliance with the British, and their territory 
            became Hyderabad State, the largest princely state in British India 
            with the city of Hyderabad as its capital. During this period, industry, 
            railways, modern education, and airways developed in Hyderabad.After 
            India's independence in 1947, the Nizam did not wish to accede his 
            state to the newly formed nation. By then, his power had weakened due 
            to the Telangana movement. The Indian Army annexed Hyderabad in 1948. 
            In 1956, the Hyderabad State[note 1] was divided on the basis of linguistic 
            differences, and the city of Hyderabad became the capital of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
